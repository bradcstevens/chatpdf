    " supervised tasks with large datasets, such\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\nis to \ufb01ne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\n3 BERT\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\nframework: pre-training and \ufb01ne-tuning . Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For \ufb01ne-\ntuning, the BERT model is \ufb01rst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are \ufb01ne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate \ufb01ne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinct",

At the output, the token rep-\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\ninto an output layer for classi\ufb01cation, such as en-\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\nCompared to pre-training, \ufb01ne-tuning is rela-\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7We de-\nscribe the task-speci\ufb01c details in the correspond-\ning subsections of Section 4.

These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce \ufb01ne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et ",

In the input to BERT, we\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\ninclude the maximal document context provided\nby the data.
