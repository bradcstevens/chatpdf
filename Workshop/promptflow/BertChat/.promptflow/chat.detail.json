Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be \ufb01ne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeci\ufb01c architecture modi\ufb01cations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful.

There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the \ufb01nal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT\u2019s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as \u201cThe Annotated Transformer.\u201d2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L",
                "g BERT\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks\u2014\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs\u2014by\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspeci\ufb01c inputs and outputs into BERT and \ufb01ne-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ?pair in text classi\ufb01cation\no",

These contextual em-\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\nthe classi\ufb01cation layer.\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERT LARGE\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art meth-\nods. The best performing method concatenates the\ntoken representations from the top four hidden lay-\ners of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only\n0.3 F1 behind \ufb01ne-tuning the entire model. This\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both \ufb01ne-\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\n6 Conclusion\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\npart of many language understanding systems. In\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\ntasks to bene\ufb01t from deep unidirectional architec-\ntures.

(2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as \u201cThe Annotated Transformer.\u201d2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L",
                    "g BERT\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks\u2014\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs\u2014by\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspeci\ufb01c inputs and outputs into BERT and \ufb01ne-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ?pair in text classi\ufb01cation\no",
                    "m one or more layers without \ufb01ne-tuning\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\nthe classi\ufb01cation layer.\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERT LARGE\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art meth-\nods. The best performing method concatenates the\ntoken representations from the top four hidden lay-\ners of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only\n0.3 F1 behind \ufb01ne-tuning the entire model. This\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both \ufb01ne-\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\n6 Conclusion\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\npart of many language understanding systems. In\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\ntasks to bene\ufb01t from deep unidirectional architec-\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\nizing these \ufb01ndings to deep bidirectional architec-\ntures, allowing the same p",

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be \ufb01ne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeci\ufb01c architecture modi\ufb01cations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful.

There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the \ufb01nal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT\u2019s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al.

(2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspeci\ufb01c inputs and outputs into BERT and \ufb01ne-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end.

These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce \ufb01ne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et \n\n## Context #4\ncoder architecture, and therefore require\na task-speci\ufb01c model architecture to be added.\nSecond, there are major computational bene\ufb01ts\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\ninclude the maximal document context provided\nby the data.

There are two steps in our\nframework: pre-training and \ufb01ne-tuning . Dur-\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For \ufb01ne-\ntuning, the BERT model is \ufb01rst initialized with\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\neters are \ufb01ne-tuned using labeled data from the\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\narate \ufb01ne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters.

All of the results in the pa-\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7We de-\nscribe the task-speci\ufb01c details in the correspond-\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\nfound in Appendix A.5.\n4 Experiments\nIn this section, we present BERT \ufb01ne-tuning re-\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\n4.1 GLUE\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\ntasks.

These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce \ufb01ne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et \n\n## Context #4\ncoder architecture, and therefore require\na task-speci\ufb01c model architecture to be added.\nSecond, there are major computational bene\ufb01ts\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\ninclude the maximal document context provided\nby the data. Following standard practice, we for-\nmulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\nHyperparams Dev Set Accuracy\n#L #H #A LM (ppl) MNLI-m MRPC SST-2\n3 768 12 5.84 77.9 79.8 88.4\n6 768 3 5.24 80.6 82.2 90.7\n6 768 12 4.68 81.9 84.8 91.3\n12 768 12 3.99 84.4 86.7 92.9\n12 1024 16 3.54 85.7 86.9 93.3\n24 1024 16 3.23 86.6 87.8 93.7\nTable 6: Ablation over BERT model size. #L = the\nnumber of layers; #H = hidden size; #A = number of at-\ntention heads. \u201cL\n\n## Context #5\n small datasets,\nso we ran several random restarts and selected the\nbest model on the Dev set.

Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be \ufb01ne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeci\ufb01c architecture modi\ufb01cations.\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks,",
                "e 1 will serve\nas a running example for this section.\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uni\ufb01ed ar-\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\nture and the \ufb01nal downstream architecture.\nModel Architecture BERT\u2019s model architec-\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\nsuch as \u201cThe Annotated Transformer.\u201d2\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L",
                "g BERT\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks\u2014\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs\u2014by\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspeci\ufb01c inputs and outputs into BERT and \ufb01ne-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end.

BERT\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\nspeci\ufb01c inputs and outputs into BERT and \ufb01ne-\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ?pair in text classi\ufb01cation\no",
                    "m one or more layers without \ufb01ne-tuning\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\nthe classi\ufb01cation layer.\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERT LARGE\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art meth-\nods. The best performing method concatenates the\ntoken representations from the top four hidden lay-\ners of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only\n0.3 F1 behind \ufb01ne-tuning the entire model. This\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both \ufb01ne-\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\n6 Conclusion\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\npart of many language understanding systems. In\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\ntasks to bene\ufb01t from deep unidirectional architec-\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\nizing these \ufb01ndings to deep bidirectional architec-\ntures, allowing the same p",
