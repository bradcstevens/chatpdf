      "Answer: A co-applicant cannot be added to a loan after the Initial Closing Disclosure (ICD) has been issued. If you wish to add a co-borrower, you will need to either remove the existing co-applicant or, if the loan does not qualify without the co-applicant, the loan will need to be adverse and a new loan application with the co-borrower will need to be submitted.

While the lender may not use tax transcript information for marketing purposes, the investor or servicer could potentially use the information for their own purposes, as outlined in their Privacy Notice. The borrower is required to sign this disclosure in order to proceed with the loan.
